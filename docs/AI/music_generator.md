AI music generator outputs potentially infringe the rights of music copyright holders. Specifically, by up-sampling copyrighted works in finely encoded segments, AI music generators create tapestries of coherent audio from the works they ingest in training, thereby infringing the United States #Copyright Act’s reproduction right[^17].
Under English copyright law, works generated by AI, can theoretically be protected as works "generated by computer in circumstances such that there is no human author of the work" (s. 178, Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)).Under UK law, it is not clear which of the fixed categories of copyright 'works' would protect a voice[^18].
When a track by artist "Ghostwriter" was uploaded and then promptly removed from streaming services in April, it was the latest example of one of 2023's most astonishing trends. The track 'heart on my sleeve' sounded like it was sung by two of the world's biggest stars, Drake and The Weeknd. In fact, it was actually someone who had used an AI tool to make his voice sound like theirs[^18].
This moment presents an opportunity for technology companies and the music industry to avoid repeating past mistakes by addressing this new disruptive technology as partners, rather than opponents[^17].
This great leap forward is made possible by the use of neural networks called variationally autoencoders (“VAEs”), which compress the cumbersome sequences of raw audio in lower-dimensional spaces where they can be efficiently processed without sacrificing structural perceptibility. The VAEs allow the audio to be analyzed at multiple compression levels to develop a holistic understanding of what is occurring in the music[^17].
the model reacts to the user’s inputs (i.e., artist, style, genre, etc.) by predicting how the respective musical elements should be redistributed, thereby generating a sample that is subsequently refined in stages from low-to-high levels of musical detail(“up-sampling”). Once the code is up-sampled to its most detailed level of musical abstraction, it is decoded back into raw audio, resulting in a new song containing the user’s desired qualities[^17].
Once the code is up-sampled to its most detailed level of musical abstraction, it is decoded back into raw audio, resulting in a new song containing the user’s desired qualities. In sum, when a generative model is engaged to make a new work, the audio that manifests as output is merely a tapestry of up-sampled sound recording fragments manipulated to resemble something ostensibly novel. Thus characterizing the AI generator’s output as “original” is misleading, because doing so disregards the role that reproduction of copyrighted works plays in generating the sample. Accordingly, we must assess whether the mechanics of machine-learning music generators can be reconciled with the protections afforded creative authors under the Copyright Act[^17].
Although research into AI music generation had already been ongoing for two decades prior to the enactment of the 1976 Copyright Act, it is unlikely that Congress envisioned machine learning as an approach to sophisticated music generation. The courts’ apparent inability to settle on a consistent reading of the Copyright Act with regard to digital sampling foreshadows the interpretive challenges that lie ahead in the AI era.[^17]
Sadly, recognition is not always tied to pecuniary benefit in the music business, and it cannot sustain the musician who requires financial security to continue creating[^17].
Humans may find themselves helpless to compete in the market against the AI systems of tomorrow, which generate their wealth of musical
know-how from the same human authors they are likely to displace. Accordingly, courts and policymakers must consider equitable, licensing-based solutions to promote a mutually beneficial AI music ecosystem for technology companies and copyright owners alike. AI may indeed someday change how music is created and consumed for the better, but we must take care not to disregard the significance of the human element in our haste to realize technology’s promise for the future[^17].

One of the latest innovations in AI technology is deepfake vocal #synthesiser s which make a singer's voice sound like a famous artist or even tools which create a wholly synthetic voice[^18].

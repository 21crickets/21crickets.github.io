Our Proposed unique platform - The Trusted Engine of Commerce

> What makes MFS so special?

> NFT EEC
> Unique moments or elements from a particular song or album
A NFT could represent the guitar riff from a famous rock song or the chorus of a beloved pop hit. Fans could collect and trade these NFTs, which would give them access to exclusive content or experiences related to the music.
Another idea is to create NFTs that represent ownership or participation in the creation of a piece of music. For example, a musician could release a song and offer NFTs that represent co-ownership of the songwriting or production royalties. Fans who purchase these NFTs would then earn a percentage of the revenue generated by the music.

> Unlock exclusive experiences related to a particular artist or band
A fan could own a NFT that gives them access to a private concert or meet-and-greet with the artist.

> Music LCL
We provide a feature for users who can generate a music by writing code and then export it, or even songwriters can create an idiosyncratic NFT as an image with metadata about the artwork.
Finally, the live producer can mint an NFT for the exported fresh code!

> NFT minor ownership
Due to our unique blockchain network capabilities, we have the ability to fractalize NFTs in some ways. We spoke about ownership before.

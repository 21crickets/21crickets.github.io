 #Exit Strategy
Exit! Exit! Exit! Our innovation ecosystems are focused on this goal above all else, thanks to the reliance on venture capital. Young potential entrepreneurs talk about exit strategies before even creating an innovation or starting a business. Our innovation ecosystems push them to do so in many ways. Seemingly straightforward questions to budding entrepreneurs such as “What is your exit strategy?” drastically shift focus and outcomes away from creating long–term societally beneficial innovations. We argue that this hypergrowth exit mindset is destroying societal wellbeing due to its laser focus on increasing socially constructed exit value above all else[^14]. 

#Risk_Management
Many NFTs have high monetary value and given their exchange velocity (digital assets can be exchanged much more quickly than physical assets), there is opportunity for fraudulent activity. To minimize this risk, NFT platforms should leverage KYC and AML procedures, as well as security best practices like two-factor authentication[^6].

#Licensing_T-Cs
It is important to be clear what rights are bestowed to owners of the NFTs, and whether these are the same or separate from the rights associated with the material object the NFT refers to. These terms are generally provided contractually in Terms and Conditions from the creator or the ecosystem operator’s platform rules. Brands with strong IP generally retain all the rights, allowing very limited rights for personal use, while newer crypto-native projects may provide owners greater commercial rights[^6].

#Legal_and_Regulatory
Because NFTs are new, there is limited legal and regulatory clarity on how existing laws may apply. Laws that may be implicated include contract, property rights, intellectual property, sweepstakes/promotions, privacy, and securities laws. Furthermore, adding to the complexity, since blockchains operate across jurisdictions, transactions involving NFTs can implicate laws outside the United States. Lawmakers, regulators, and courts are still in the process of evaluating how to treat NFTs under existing laws, and whether new laws are needed to protect collectors, artists, and other participants in the NFT ecosystem. Accordingly, it is highly recommended that businesses consult an attorney that has the relevant subject matter expertise. Due to the regulatory uncertainty, there is risk in any transaction involving NFTs[^6].

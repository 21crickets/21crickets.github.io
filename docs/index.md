> **MFS: a music NFT decentralized blanket licensing platform**

> *As merry as a mars cricket*

> **Play, Mix, Own, Govern, Earn, Self-releasing, Co-Owned, M2E, and Pay as you go TRXs**

# Notice

> We have not released the LTS version yet. At the following link, you will know that there are stable and draft versions. So, both of them do not count as latest-version-Stable.ASAP, we will release links with the LTS flag.

# Environmental issues
> The environmental consequences of NFTs can no longer go unaddressed. **ETH 2.0 still generates 10 million mcg CO2 per Mint!** *(Equivalent to charging your smartphone nine times).*

> **One NFT mint on our infrastructure is a mere 1.2 mcg CO2.** A human exhales 30 times more CO2 in one exhale.Enjoy scalability (6000 tps), painless transactions *(It is not just for saying that we can claim it)*
>
> Sociable Weaver - A seamless UX/UI with blockchain under the hood for organizations and individuals to manage assets like music.

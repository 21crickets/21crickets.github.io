### Polkadot Hackathon Global Series: APAC Edition 2023
We registered in the Polkadot Hackathon Global Series: APAC Edition 2023.
Arman Riazi is waiting to team up for hackathon with followed subject; He hope to get it hold of onetime because work on dynamic NFTs of Unique network needs more time and having ready a team with inclusion of TS, Rust and ReactJS as a part of needed experiences in short/midterm:

> The dynamic NFT Lab
> Winner â€“ Up to $5000

Building upon the momentum generated by our previous hackathons, we rally all builders in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region to join us on this journey. With Polkadot as your foundation, this hackathon is your chance to be at the forefront of blockchain innovation across 5 themes: Interfaces & Experiences, ink!

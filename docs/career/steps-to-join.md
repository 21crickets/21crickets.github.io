# FiveSteps to join Army

**Notice** 
Repositories are temporary on my Github. After we reach alpha targets, we are going to move projects to the new devops infrastructure.
I made a monorepo of all of the repositories in all programming languages. You should pay attention to and be aware of configuration files in the root workspace.

## Check the project out 

???+ tip

    Currently, we do not have any kind of programme for managing and analysing the team's performance. Basically, I do not believe in scrum frameworks or any kind of methodology. This work is customised with our agreement, but it is an obligation cos it would be the perfect dashboard for the project to show off to investors, for example. It also gives us a better perspective on discipline.

Pls open the project section on Github. I entered some sample data. You can put your iteration in, and after that, you will know:

> [About-Milestones](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones)

> At the first `Efficiency` and `Performance` is setted by you, but CTO after the iteration will review it again.

`Efficiency` column or `Positive Prediction` means:
`How much would be your estimation to complete the next iteration based on the current iteration?`

!!! info "Example"

    I am in iteration no. 1 (first week). After spending 4 or 7 days, I would have found that the tasks were completed easily and quickly. So, in this situation, I must set `Efficiency` to `25`.

`Performance` column or `Aggregated Result as a Kind of the Postdiction` means:
`How much would your estimation be to keep going with the current iteration based on all of the previous iterations?`

!!! info "Example"

    I am in iteration no. 3 (third week). After spending 4 or 7 days, I would have found that the tasks were completed easily and quickly. So, in this situation, I must set `Performance` to `1` cos my performance has not decreased. But if I had found that my performance decreased, I would have adjusted `Performance` to `0.25`, for example.

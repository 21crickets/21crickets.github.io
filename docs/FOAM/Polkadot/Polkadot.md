The Polkadot network has several entities engaged in handling transactions: collator, validator, nominator, and fisherman. Collators produce proofs for the validators. Transactions are then executed and aggregated in blocks. There is the possibility of collators to pool, to coordinate and share the rewards coming from creating blocks on the parachains they actuate. Validators produce and finalize blocks on the relay chain. The validator role is contingent on a stake that is put on hold to foment good behavior. Validators who misbehave can have their block rewards denied or, in case of recurrence, have their security bond confiscated. Validators are the equivalent to groups of cooperating miners that share block rewards proportionally to their contribution (mining pools) on PoW systems (e.g., Bitcoin). Nominators provide their own stake to validators, whereby sharing the rewards and incurring potential slashing, in case of misbehaving. Fishermen get bounties for reporting validators’ misbehavior, such as helping to ratify an invalid block. Polkadot’s relay chain uses Substrate. Polkadot’s state machine is compiled to WASM, a virtual environment that can execute the state transition functions [93]. Libp2p is a network library for peer-to-peer applications, written in the Rust programming language. Parachains run the application logic, creating transactions as needed. Collators group those transactions and redirect them to Validators, who then deem blocks as valid or invalid. After that, the valid ones are added to the relay chain.Polkadot uses the DOT token as an incentive for nodes to behave correctly. DOT has several purposes: (i) decentralize governance (i.e., protocol updates), (ii) operation (i.e., rewarding good actors), and (iii) bonding (i.e., adding new parachains)[^16].

Upgrading conventional blockchains requires forking the network, often taking months of work, and particularly contentious hard forks can break apart a community. Polkadot revolutionizes this process, enabling blockchains to upgrade themselves without
the need to fork the chain. These forkless upgrades are enacted through Polkadot’s transparent on-chain governance system[^2].

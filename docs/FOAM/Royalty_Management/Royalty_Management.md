> When I buy music rights through Royal, what do I get?
When you invest in songs or albums on Royal, you get a token representing a percentage of the music’s streaming rights, plus extras. You earn royalties alongside the artist and get paid when they do.
Artists choose what percentage of the song's royalties to drop. They can also attach extras like fan experiences, exclusive tracks, merch, and more—it's all up to them[^4].
> How do I buy a token during a drop?
During a drop, you can buy a token through Royal’s website with a credit card. Before you buy, you’ll be able to see the percentage of ownership per token tier, the extras attached, and information about pricing[^4].
> If you get a token during a drop, it will appear on your Royal dashboard. Missed out on a drop? 
You can buy a token on our music rights marketplace.
Create a free Royal account to receive email notifications about upcoming drops. You can also follow us on social media to keep up with the latest releases[^4].
> How do I claim streaming royalties?
Once you buy a token, your royalties start accruing as the song, EP, or album streams on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.
You get paid your portion of the royalties when the artist gets paid. The time to payout will vary depending on the artist—on average, payouts happen every 6 months—and we’ll notify you when royalties become available to claim.
Once available, you’ll claim your royalties in your Royal dashboard by transferring funds to another crypto wallet[^4].

> Can I sell my token?
Yes, you can list your token for sale any time on royal.
One exciting part of purchasing music rights is that these assets may appreciate—artist and song popularity, token demand, extras, and more can all play a role in secondary pricing.
Once you sell your token, royalty payouts and unclaimed extras will go to the new token owner[^4].

Royalty advances are essential to musicians because they provide a source of upfront income before the actual royalties from music sales and streams start coming in. This can be particularly useful for musicians who are just starting out, or for established musicians who need financial support to produce new music, pay for promotional activities, or cover living expenses[^2].
A royalty advance is similar to a loan that a record label or publishing company provides to a musician, based on their expected future earnings from music sales and streams. The advance is then recouped from the artist's future royalties. In other words, the artist repays the advance by dedicating a portion of their future earnings to the lender[^2].

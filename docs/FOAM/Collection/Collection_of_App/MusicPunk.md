The Cryptopunks project was developed by Larva Labs in 2017, then a two-person team of Canadian software developers who took inspiration from the cyberpunk movement, edgy electronic music, and films about a dystopian, technological future like Blade Runner. Demonstrating a future of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on what was at the time a burgeoning blockchain called Ethereum, Cryptopunks added a whole new perspective to the intersection of digital collectibles, cryptocurrency, and the entire concept of art and commerce online.This project was also an inspiration for the ERC-721 standard, becoming a framework on the blockchain for the birth and continual growth of non-fungible tokens. Years later, as NFTs captured the attention of everyone from world-famous celebrities to the titans of the traditional art world, like Sotheby’s, Cryptopunks led this mass global craze for NFTs. As of writing, the lowest price available to pick up a punk of your own is around 103.7 ETH ($362,390 USD), and rare punks are selling for upwards of $10,000,000. We believe that MusicPunks will be the best case study for Unique NFT capabilities. We’re equally excited to deploy additional advanced features for NFTs.

The MFS Staking Hub has made it easy for users to stake and unstake [[UNQ]] and [[MFS]] tokens, supporting the development of the MFS decentralized application. By betting their tokens, users can earn rewards while contributing to the growth of the blockchain. The staking program offers a percent of [[APY]], generated through inflation and funded by the MFS [[Treasury]].
Additionally, the application allows users to grow their capital while [[sponsor]]ing dApp transactions and supporting the MFA application. With partial unstaking, users can easily manage their funds, providing better liquidity access.

Unique Network is going to offer several gas fee models for its users in order to provide as much flexibility as possible to adapt to miscellaneous marketing strategies of application developers and remove UX friction for the newcomers.
The gas fee model is configured separately for each [[Collection]] or a [[smartcontract]]. Every Collection and smart contract has a fee model assigned to it, which determines how its #transaction s are paid, and the developer can choose the fee model that better suits their application[^1].
Initially the fee model is configured to a default one and can be updated later at any time and as many times as needed.Currently there are two models implemented: The default #User_paid_fees model when the transaction sender pays all gas fees, and the #Pay_as_you_go model when collection or smart contract owners enable #sponsor ing for certain transaction types for their users[^1].
Contract Ownership Like collections and NFTs, smart contracts in Unique Network are also owned. The ownership is atomically assigned at the moment of contract deployment, so the contract is owned by the address that deployed it. Later on the owner can configure fee sponsoring for that contract. Fees Payable with ERC-20, Ethereum([[UNQ]], and [[MFS]]), or Even Valuable NFTs. One of the coming soon perks of using the flexible economic models is the capability to pay fees directly with the Applicationâ€™s own Fungible (a.k.a. ERC-20) token minted within the Unique Chain. Once the exchange rate between Unique and the application token can be established, the application will be allowed to switch to paying fees with its own token. Combined with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other bridges, this feature opens the wide range of possibilities to inter-operate between networks, since theoretically any value (not even limited to Fungible tokens, but also Re-Fungible ) transferred from over the other networks, can be used for transaction fee payment[^1].

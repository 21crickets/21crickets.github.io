Exit! Exit! Our innovation ecosystems are focused on this goal above all else, thanks to the reliance on venture capital. Young potential entrepreneurs talk about exit strategies before even creating an innovation or starting a business. Our innovation ecosystems push them to do so in many ways. Seemingly straightforward questions to budding entrepreneurs such as \u201cWhat is your exit strategy?\u201d drastically shift focus and outcomes away from creating long\u2013term societally beneficial innovations.

Lawmakers, regulators, and courts are still in the process of evaluating how to treat NFTs under existing laws, and whether new laws are needed to protect collectors, artists, and other participants in the NFT ecosystem.

The first is ownership-based NFTs, which \u201care basically tied to IP [intellectual property] rights and royalties. So, when you buy the NFT, you now are entitled to the accrual of revenue that is produced from Web2 audio streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, etc.\u201d <sup>1</sup>. The second is patronage-based NFTs, which do not grant holders any ownership rights but \u201care collected to support an artist.\u201d According to Levy, \u201cThe upside of the NFT is sort of derived from appreciating secondary sales.\u201d<sup>1</sup>. Spotify says it paid out $7 billion in royalties in 2021 alone, a figure the company claims \u201cis the largest sum paid by one retailer to the music industry in one year in history.\u201d But the vast majority of that money went directly to record labels and publishers, which collect enormous percentages for themselves before passing what\u2019s left on to the artists. Plus, Spotify reportedly pays only $0.003 to $0.005 per stream, and major record labels negotiate higher payouts than independent artists receive<sup>1</sup>. At first glance, NFT music could be a blockchain alternative for purchasing songs from iTunes. However, when you buy a song from iTunes, you only buy the rights to listen to that track. There is no ownership of the content on iTunes \u2014 only the license to listen to what you just paid for. In contrast, musical NFTs allow anyone to listen to music and also grant ownership of that music to the holder. NFT music seems counter-intuitive: why buy the music you can already listen to? The answer to this question is the same as buying a JPEG image, anyone can right-click and save it. Markets, or people, find value in ownership of original and unique proven assets<sup>2</sup>. There is a wide range of potential use cases for musical NFTs. They can be used to provide access to discounted concert tickets, special areas at concerts, or meet and greets. It all depends on how the artist wants to structure the NFTs they generate<sup>2</sup>. Catalogs are the leading marketplace for single-issue music NFTs, a category known as 1/1 in the NFT world. It is based on the Zora protocol and also powers one of OpenSea\u2019s competitor marketplace. As of February 2021, the artist has sold $ 2 million worth of music NFTs in its catalog<sup>2</sup>. Some artists like to release limited editions, e.g. 10 NFTs tied to a track, as opposed to 1/1s.Where collectors or traders can create edits of a musical NFT. These newly created NFTs can be instantly resold on secondary markets like OpenSea or Rarible. Some DAOs offer grants to NFT artists. Holders vote each month to donate ETH to three musicians through crowdfunding<sup>2</sup>. Other DAOs are investment-oriented. Noise DAO started with 65 initial members who have accumulated 1,720 ETH to date, with the mission to incubate NFT artists and invest in NFT music<sup>2</sup>. The platform also has other innovative features: Artists can take out DeFi loans against the value of royalties they generate over a year. DeFi investors can stake crypto assets to provide funding and receive high returns \u2014 though the DeFi risks remain<sup>2</sup>. How about Music NFT Videos, anyways? Perhaps because it\u2019s a more capital-intensive venture than other aspects of music NFTs, there aren\u2019t many music video NFT projects<sup>2</sup>.</p> <ol> <li> <p>DeYoung, J.

You found us and selected the group successfully, which means you have enough IQ or EQ.

However, you would not have joined the army. So, for these candidates there are some promotion and reward. They can show off their work as a internship experience on their CV with reputation of our brand. We have discretion for using their work in the future and you are still in our network; however, they will take a portation of the <code>Army Staking Program (ASP)</code>. We will have staked 2-5% of our token (MFS). ASPs mechanism will be locked on our platform or mightbe in a third party.

It must not exceed of 300 candidates. We may have 1000 candidate in the army,   and they were going to do. It is clear for us when they have not done any tasks on Github. So, we only distribute profits to active users who had done at least one successful task or   at least 2 failed task. So, we provide rewards in spite of the fact that he/she failed to do a task successfully in the opinion of the administrator.</p> Warning <p>1. Percent of staked value of ASP belongs to the platform, and who are in the army do not have any kind of rights to tokens or company, provided the situation is only a chance to give privileges to Knight(Main chart of company) or taking stacked tokens by the platform. 2. We only emphasize on activity(failed or success) and every kind of activity has gotten a reward. 3. We carried out our proposed token distribution with all programs (as pointed out) for every kind of registering and formal correcpondace with voucher innovations/research instituations. So it is not possible for us to ignore our plan and strategies.</p> <p>Success</p> <p>Final Step  After being accepted, you will join as a full-time knight. You will be one of our formal co-worker, and we will utilize 17-19% of shares alongside so many other benefits that  recruiters will speak about it during the final interview. So, in all process and steps, we will have one or two interviews with you because most of your success depends on your activity, and reports that we will be given.</p>"},{"location":"career/steps-to-join/","title":"FiveSteps to join Army","text":"<p>Notice  Repositories are temporary on my Github.
